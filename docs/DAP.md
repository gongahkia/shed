# Debug Adapter Protocol Architecture

Shed's debug architecture is adapter-capability driven. The Debug Adapter Protocol separates the editor from language-specific debuggers. Configuration is validated before a transport can start; the transport does not select configurations, launch a debuggee, collect telemetry, or download adapters.

## Safe Defaults

- `debug.enabled = false`; no adapter or configuration is built in.
- Adapters are user-managed and configured only in global `~/.shed/config.toml` by default.
- Project `.shed.toml` debug settings are unsafe and remain blocked until `project.config.allow.unsafe = true` and the project config is trusted.
- Adapter commands are direct executable tokens plus whitespace-separated arguments; Shed does not invoke a shell.
- Configuration scope is always `workspace`; `cwd` and launch `program` must remain under `${workspaceFolder}`, except `${file}` for the active workspace file.
- Attach targets are loopback-only (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`) in M0.

## TOML Schema

```toml
schema_version = 1

"debug.enabled" = true
"debug.breakpoints.enabled" = true
"debug.threads.enabled" = true
"debug.stacktrace.enabled" = true
"debug.scopes.enabled" = true
"debug.variables.enabled" = true
"debug.evaluate.enabled" = true
"debug.attach.enabled" = true

"debug.adapter.java.command" = "java-debug-adapter"
"debug.adapter.java.args" = "--stdio"
"debug.adapter.java.transport" = "stdio"
"debug.adapter.java.capabilities" = "launch,attach,configuration_done,breakpoints,threads,stack_trace,scopes,variables,evaluate"

"debug.configuration.main.adapter" = "java"
"debug.configuration.main.request" = "launch"
"debug.configuration.main.scope" = "workspace"
"debug.configuration.main.program" = "${file}"
"debug.configuration.main.cwd" = "${workspaceFolder}"
"debug.configuration.main.args" = ""
```

Adapter identifiers and configuration names are `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`. `transport` is `stdio` (default) or `tcp`; `stdio` requires `command`, while `tcp` must not set one. Capabilities are comma-separated: `launch`, `attach`, `configuration_done`, `breakpoints`, `threads`, `stack_trace`, `scopes`, `variables`, and `evaluate`.

Each configuration requires `adapter` and `request` (`launch` or `attach`). A launch requires a workspace-scoped `program`. An attach requires a loopback `host` and `port` from `1..65535`. Invalid fields are reported with TOML line and column during config loading; Shed retains safe defaults and does not create a launch plan.

## Future Session Boundary

A debug session may only give the transport a validated `Plan`: selected adapter, declared capabilities, configuration, workspace root, resolved working directory, and resolved program. It must perform DAP initialization before later adapter-specific launch or attach requests and honor the capabilities returned by the adapter. Adapter-specific request arguments remain deferred because DAP leaves them adapter-defined.

## Transport Boundary

`DebugAdapterTransport` implements the DAP base framing: ASCII `Content-Length` headers and UTF-8 JSON objects. It accepts only bounded frames (16 KiB headers and 8 MiB bodies), validates JSON syntax before dispatch, and treats malformed or truncated adapter output as an isolated session failure. A failure completes outstanding requests, closes streams/sockets, stops a stdio adapter process, and reports a local diagnostic; it does not crash the editor.

- It requires `debug.enabled`; attach plans also require `debug.attach.enabled` before opening a process or socket.
- `stdio` starts the configured direct executable in the validated workspace `cwd`. Adapter stderr is drained separately, never mixed into the DAP stdout stream.
- `tcp` connects only to the validated loopback host and port. It never starts a local adapter process.
- Request timeouts issue DAP `cancel` only after the adapter declares `supportsCancelRequest`; otherwise Shed ignores a late response.
- Closing a transport sends `disconnect` when possible, setting `terminateDebuggee` for launch sessions only, then closes the connection and terminates a stdio adapter if it remains alive.
- Adapter-initiated requests receive a deterministic unsupported response until a later feature supplies a handler. Events and responses are delivered separately.

The transport has no UI dependency and records to `DiagnosticLog` only when its caller supplies one; it performs no telemetry or network access other than an explicitly configured loopback TCP connection.

## Adapter Detection

`DebugAdapterDetector` reports configured adapter and configuration availability for one workspace without starting an adapter, opening a socket, or modifying workspace state. Missing executables and invalid debug settings are remediation states only; `normalEditingAvailable` remains true.

Adapter versions are `NOT_PROBED`: the published DAP schema has no adapter-discovery or version request, and Shed does not invoke a configured adapter with guessed arguments during read-only detection. The report exposes each declared capability as `AVAILABLE`, `DISABLED` by the corresponding debug setting, or `UNDECLARED`, plus launch/attach configuration availability. Resolution is skipped while `debug.enabled=false`.
